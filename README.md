# React + Vite + Typescript + Tauri
Welcome to the **React + Vite + TypeScript + Tauri** Proof of Concept (PoC) project! This repository demonstrates how integrating a Rust backend with Tauri can deliver blazing-fast performance within a simple timer application. By combining React for the frontend, Vite for rapid development, TypeScript for type safety, and Tauri for building lightweight desktop applications, this project showcases the synergy of these technologies in creating efficient and responsive applications.
